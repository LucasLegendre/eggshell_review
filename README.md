# eggshell_review

Contains the dataset, phylogenetic tree, and R code related to analyses for the following study:

Legendre, L. J., S. Choi, and J. A. Clarke. 2022. The diverse terminology of reptile eggshell microstructure and its effect on phylogenetic comparative analyses. <i>Journal of Anatomy</i>.

File description:

- 'Eggshell_review_project.html': HTML tutorial for the code used in the paper (all references and a detailed description of the protocol can be found in the online Supplementary Information of the paper)

- 'Eggshell_review_project.Rmd': original R script used to generate the HTML file, in Markdown format

- 'Datawhole_newproject.txt': dataset in TXT format, containing egg measurements and scoring for all three scoring procedures for 208 species of reptiles (fully referenced version is included as Supplementary Table 1 in Legendre et al., 2022)

- 'treewhole_newversion.trees.nex': phylogenetic tree for dataset, in NEXUS format

NOTE:

The tree as published in the reference cited above contains one minor error (M. Fabbri, pers. comm.): eggs originally attributed to taxon <i>Orodromeus makelai</i> (Dinosauria, Ornithischia – see Horner and Weishampel, 1988; Hirsch and Quinn, 1990) were later identified as eggs of a troodontid (Dinosauria, Theropoda – see Horner and Weishampel, 1996; Varricchio et al., 1997). We have modified the position of this taxon in our tree to reflect this change, which does not affect our results.
